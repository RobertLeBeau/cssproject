      <p> My name is Robert LeBeau. I am currently pursuing a Master's
        degree in Information Technology and Management with a specialization
        in Computer and Information Security from the Illinois Institute of
        Technology. I graduated from the University of Iowa in 2013 with a
        degree in Microbiology and it was during my time there that I met my
        wife Kate. We got married in September 2016 and currently live in
        Chicago, Illinois with our cat, Sophie.

      <p> I love spending time with my family and friends and try to take every
        chance I can get to hang out with the people in my life. However, as a full time
        graduate student, who also works part time, my free time seems to escape me a little
        more each day. I value my free time but also know when it's time to get to work.
        Hopefully my website will allow you to get to know both sides of me: the
        business professional, and the fun loving computer geek!
