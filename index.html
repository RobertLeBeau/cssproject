      <p> My name is Robert LeBeau. I am currently pursuing a Master's
        degree in Information Technology and Management with a specialization
        in Computer and Information Security from the Illinois Institute of
        Technology. I graduated from the University of Iowa in 2013 with a
        degree in Microbiology and it was during my time at there that I met my
        wife Kate. We got married in September 2016 and currently live in
        Cicero, Illinois with our cat, Sophie.
